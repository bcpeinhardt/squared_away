### A statically typed spreadsheet with testing as a first class citizen

This project is really really new. This repo contains a prototype
spreadsheet in Gleam implemented as a Lustre app, which will allow 
me to quickly iterate on the formula language and the spreadsheet UX.

The intention is to get a good idea of what I actually want an MVP
to look like, then do a rewrite as a native app using a lower level 
language.
